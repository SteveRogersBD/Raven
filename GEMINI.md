# Why We Chose Gemini 3: The Heart of PlateIt 🧠

**PlateIt** is not just a recipe app; it is a **multimodal culinary assistant**, and **Google Gemini 3.0 Flash Preview** is the intelligent engine that makes it possible. We integrated Gemini as the central orchestrator because its native multimodal capabilities solve the most complex problem in home cooking: **understanding context**.

Traditionally, recipe apps rely on text search. With Gemini 3, PlateIt can "see" your pantry through your camera, instantly identifying multiple ingredients in a chaotic fridge shelf without needing manual entry. This leverages Gemini's superior **vision-language reasoning**, which doesn't just label objects but understands culinary potential—knowing that "eggs, flour, and milk" can become pancakes.

Furthermore, we utilize Gemini's massive **context window** to process entire cooking videos. Instead of just searching for a title, our agent "watches" the video content to extract precise, step-by-step instructions that might be missing from the description. This allows users to turn a viral social media clip into a structured, cookable recipe card in seconds.

Finally, the **speed and efficiency** of the Flash model ensure that our conversational Chef Agent feels responsive and helpful, providing real-time guidance, substitutions, and nutritional advice as if a professional chef were standing right next to you in the kitchen.
